\title{Area of Occupancy (AOO)}
\usage{
aoo(thepoints, cellsize = 2000, returnV = "S")
}
\arguments{
\item{thepoints}{set of points in metres i.e. c(x,y)}

\item{cellsize}{size of cell (length) in metres}

\item{returnV, }{switches to return different sets of results:
S = Simple, returns just the minimum are in km2, (DEFAULT)
E = Expended simple, returns the solution for the smallest AOO as list of (area,number of cells, rotation (degrees), shift in x direction, shift in y direction)
SF = returns a polygon simple feature for mapping, plotting in ggplot or export to GIS systems}
}
\value{
as returnV, default is area in km2
}
\description{
Calculates the number of occupied cells for Area of Occupancy from a set of points (x,y), in metres, with origin 0,0.
