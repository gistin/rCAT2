\title{Area of Occupancy (AOO) calculated by Systematic shifting and rotating of the grid}
\usage{
aooFixedRotation(
  thepoints,
  cellsize = 2000,
  it = 1296,
  returnV = "S",
  rotation = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{thepoints}{dataframe of points in metres i.e. c(x,y)}

\item{cellsize}{width of cell in metres (default 2000 m)}

\item{it}{the number of iterations you wish it to run, (default 1296)}

\item{returnV, }{switches to return different sets of results:
S = Simple, returns just the minimum are in km2, (DEFAULT)  
E = Expended simple, returns the solution for the smallest AOO  as list of (area,number of cells, rotation (degrees), shift in x direction, shift in y direction)  
ALL = returns a dataframe of all of the results with (number of cells, rotation (radians), shift in x direction (metres), shift in y direction (metres))  
SF = returns a polygon simple feature for mapping, plotting in ggplot or export to GIS systems.}

\item{rotation}{allow rotation of grids? (default = TRUE). If rotations are selected iterations are shared 50:50 rotation:shift}
}
\value{
dependent on switch, default is area in km2
}
\description{
Calculates the Area of Occupancy AOO (smallest) by shifting and rotating the grid in x and y direction only.
In a very few occasions the minimum solution will not always be achieved but it is quick and consistent (not driven by the number of points).
If your species is near a threshold you may want to increase the number of iterations.
